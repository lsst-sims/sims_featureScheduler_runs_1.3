XXX--This run had a bug in the twilight observations, see the v1.4 runs for corrected simulations.

Doing a near-sun solar system twilight survey, based on Seaman et al white paper

If we use all the twilight time for a NEO survey, we no longer meet the SRD requirements. We can run the twilight NEO search every 3 or 4 days, and that should make it possible to stil meet SRD.
