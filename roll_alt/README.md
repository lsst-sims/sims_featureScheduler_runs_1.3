An attempt to combine the alt-sched behavior of alternating north and south with the rolling cadence notion of emphasizing different declination bands different years.

## alt_wfd

Attept to chop the WFD region in half, and observe north on even days and south on odd days. Should drive a 0.5 day^-1 cadence in the WFD region. The other regions are left unchanged, so should be similar to before. We could include other regions (e.g., the galactic plane) in the behavior if we wanted to.


## alt_roll

Have two things combined--use the delayed rolling and alternate north and south by day. Note that this involves dividing the WFD into quarters. It should also be possible to divide the WFD north and south into thirds if we wanted to. With this sim, we expect that during the rolling periods, half the WFD area will have 0.5 day^-1 cadence. That could be changed to 1/3 or 2/3 fairly easily.

One nice aspect of this type of rolling cadence is that the area of emphasis is always split north and south of the observatory, so fewer observatories would ever be shut out of following up alerts. In our usual rolling cadence experiments, the southern half of WFD can be the emphasis region, which would mean very few alerts for northern hemisphere telescopes to follow. Also, having the alerts concentrated in the south could overwhelm (even more than usual) the southern follow-up facilities.

## alt_roll_w

Same as alt_roll, but vary the weight on the footprint to try and get a smoother result in the end that meets SRD.
